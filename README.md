# Fraud-Detection-ML

Fraudulent Transactions Prediction Case
Overview
This repository contains the necessary resources and code for the development of a machine learning model to predict fraudulent transactions for a financial company. The dataset provided is in CSV format, consisting of 6362620 rows and 10 columns. The goal is to build a robust model that can identify and classify fraudulent transactions accurately.

Dataset
The dataset is available in the data directory in CSV format. It contains the following columns:

TransactionID: Unique identifier for each transaction.
TransactionDT: Transaction datetime.
TransactionAmt: Transaction amount.
ProductCD: Product code.
card1 to card6: Card-related information.
addr1 and addr2: Address information.
isFraud: Binary indicator of whether the transaction is fraudulent (1) or not (0).
